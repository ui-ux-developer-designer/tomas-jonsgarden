<p> <strong>Tomas Jonsgården</strong> specializes in telling beautiful stories within the constraints of a commercial, putting out memorable pieces for an array of top-shelf clients that includes Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Sony Ericsson, Tmobile, Volvo, VISA, MTV, Lenovo, Apoteket and KappAhl. His KappAhl collaboration with actor Richard Gere was so successful that the superstar insisted Jonsgården direct his next commercial project. Jonsgården further enhances his work via special creative relationship with esteemed photographers Adam Kimmel, Stefan Czapsky, Affonso Beato and Jan Velicky among others. </p> <p> Jonsgården has earned honors from Cannes Lions, the Gold Baltic Awards, Epica, Eurobest, the Moscow Film Festival, Golden Hammer, New York Festivals, Voitto, Golden Drum, the Swedish Advertising Festival ROY, The Golden Egg and the Chicago International Film Festival. In 2007, Tomas was voted "The Most Successful Commercial Director” in Finland and Sweden from the major agencies and the renowned ad-magazine Dagens Media. </p> <p> With a global client base, Jonsgården is repped by top studios around the world, including Anonymous Content in the US, Knucklehead in the UK and Flodellfilm in Scandinavia. He launched the directing portion of his career in 2001, when he teamed up with Forsberg & Co Stockholm and began honing his personal style through commercials, music videos and Swedish TV jobs. Prior to focusing on directing, Jonsgården worked as a still photographer, studying under fashion photographer Mattias Edwall, among others. He attended university in the city of Uppsala, Sweden. </p> <p> It’s no coincidence that Jonsgården’s life path has led him to directing. Born into a family of Academia, he was raised to question and to wonder; a gift that turned his interest from music to photography to director. </p>
